# Startgate-HorusHelmet
Design and code for a replica Horus Guard mask from the movie Stargate.

## V1
The simplest option, two LED's (mounted behind the eyes) used to indicate the
mood/mode of the character/gear. A white LED to indicate standard mode and a Red
LED for an angry or attack mode. This is more of an initial, fallback setup but
simple to get up and running.
